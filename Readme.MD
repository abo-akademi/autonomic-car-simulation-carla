   - [‚ùå] LIDAR processing
   - [‚ùå] Collision prediction
2. [‚ùå] Avoidance Logic
```

### Milestone 3: Route Planning
```markdown
1. [‚ùå] Navigation
   - [‚ùå] Waypoint following
   - [‚ùå] Lane change logic
2. [‚ùå] Traffic Systems
```

### Test Commands Cheatsheet
```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py --all

# Milestone-specific tests
python ai_test.py -m 1  # Basic movement
python ai_test.py -m 3  # Obstacle avoidance
python ai_test.py -m 2  # Full route
```
### Blockers
1. Steering angle calculation needs math verification
2. LIDAR sensor gives noisy data at high speeds
3. Waypoint connections sometimes break at intersections
